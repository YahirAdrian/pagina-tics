                        <p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:12.15pt;margin-left:8.15pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:.3pt;line-height:92%;font-size:20px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;color:black;'>At the end of December 2019 in Wuhan, China, an outbreak of pneumonia was detected, marking the origin and onset of what would later be known as &apos;COVID-19&apos;. This brought about a series of implications and changes in various fields, including science, economy, and society, specifically in the academic domain (Escudero et al., 2021).</p>
                        <p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:12.15pt;margin-left:8.15pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:.3pt;line-height:92%;font-size:20px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;color:black;'>As mentioned earlier, the COVID-19 virus pandemic forced many schools to opt for Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) to continue courses that could not be conducted in person. This proved to be a challenging transition for both educators and students, who had to learn to adapt to a new style of learning (virtual distance learning) departing from the traditional classroom education that had been the norm for decades.</p>
                        <p><span style='font-size:20px;line-height:92%;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;color:black;'>This led to teachers of the old school having to learn how to use electronic devices and tools that would enable them to carry out assessment and educational activities. They also had to learn how to use audiovisual streaming platforms to conduct their classes while maintaining proper interaction with their students. However, it was not all about adaptation, as many Students who were familiar with technology and such platforms found this new method of teaching and learning very easy and comfortable. This generated new interests and potential outcomes for online education and learning.</span></p>

                        <p>During the pandemic, online education became the primary mode of learning for students around the world. The effects on learning were mixed. On one hand, online education provided a lifeline for educational continuity, allowing students to continue their studies despite school closures. It enabled access to learning materials and virtual classrooms. However, the sudden shift to online learning posed challenges.</p>
                        <p>Many students faced difficulties adapting to remote learning, such as technological barriers, lack of social interaction, and reduced teacher-student engagement. Additionally, the digital divide exacerbated educational inequalities, as students from disadvantaged backgrounds had limited access to necessary technology and resources. Overall, while online education helped mitigate the impact of the pandemic on learning, it also highlighted the need for improved infrastructure, support, and equitable access to ensure quality education for all.</p>

                        <p>The impact of learning during the pandemic varied for different students and educational contexts. While many students were able to continue their education through online platforms and remote learning, it is important to acknowledge that the pandemic posed numerous challenges to effective learning. </p>
                        <p>The sudden shift to online learning presented challenges for students, teachers, and parents. Not all students were equally prepared or had access to necessary resources like stable internet connections, devices, or conducive learning environments. This disparity in access and preparedness could affect the quality and effectiveness of learning.</p>

                        <p>As previously mentioned, students will begin to be independent when carrying out investigations and tasks.</p>
                        <p>During the pandemic, there has been a greater emphasis on independent learning as traditional classrooms shift to online or remote learning formats. Independent learning refers to students taking responsibility for their own learning process, managing their time, accessing resources, and engaging in self-directed study.</p>
                        <p>The COVID-19 pandemic required a significant shift toward independent learning as educational institutions around the world transitioned to remote or online instruction. Students were asked to take more responsibility for their learning by engaging in self-directed study and managing their time effectively. With reduced in-person interaction and increased reliance on digital resources, students had to adapt to access and use online materials, participate in virtual discussions, and complete assignments independently.</p>
